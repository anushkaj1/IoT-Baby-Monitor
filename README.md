# IoT-Baby-Monitor
Code for Baby Monitor project created for Introduction to IoT course.
<br><br>
The baby monitor is a small door which latches when a baby moves in front of it. It is made keeping in mind the safety of babies in dangerous spots within domestic spaces, e.g. balconies, kitchen, staircases, etc.

Two motion sensors are used to detect whether the movement recorded is of an adult or a baby. This is done by placing one of the sensors close to the ground and the other one at a height greater than that of the baby. When the movement of the baby is recorded in front of the door, the door is immediately latched and a notification is sent to the parent using the Blynk app. Data is also uploaded on OM2M. When the baby moves away from the door (detected using ultrasonic sensors), the door is unlatched.
